# Our people

1. Our personality is a wide range of characteristic that each person possesses. Each of them determines the choices we make throughout our entire live. For example, impulsive and emotional people tend to choose creative jobs, like being an artist. In contrast, emotionally stable often prefer to study something that will make them sit at the desk all day long. The introverts and the extroverts are two of a kind, when it comes to hobbies or interests, though not every time. Cycling, or joining a reading club might suit both of them, you can enjoy both of the activities alone as well as with other people. However, it's hard to say the same about the appearance: more expressive people tend to choose fancy, bright clothes and accessories, while the more reserved would choose the most common or plain and classic look. Choosing friends based on the personality is quite questionable in adulthood, especially when compared with childhood, where you choose your friends based on the described above and what reflects your personality, rather than interests like in an adulthood.
